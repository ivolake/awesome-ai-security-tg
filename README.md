## How to Contribute

This repository is intended to become a living map of AI Security Telegram.

1. **Suggest new channels/chats**

   - Open an issue or PR.
   - Provide: `@handle`, language, 1–2 sentence description, and why it is relevant to AI security / MLSecOps / LLM security.

2. **Propose re-tiering**

   - T1 is for consistently high-signal, author-driven channels with strong AI security focus.
   - T2 is for feeds, adjacent topics, niche or emerging channels.
   - In your PR, explain why a channel should move tiers (signal, posting frequency, focus shift, etc.).

3. **Keep it on-topic**

   - Focus on: AI security, MLSecOps, LLM/agent security, adversarial ML, AGI security and governance with a clear security angle.
   - General ML, generic infosec or news-only feeds without AI security focus should stay out of scope.
